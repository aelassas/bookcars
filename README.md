## Backend
BookCars is supplier oriented. This means that there are three types of users:

* Admin: He has full access to backend. He can do everything.
* Supplier: He has restricted access to backend. He can only manage his cars and bookings.
* User: He has only access to frontend and mobile app. He cannot access the backend.

BookCars is designed to work with multiple suppliers. Each supplier can manage his car fleet and bookings from the backend. BookCars can also work with only one supplier too.

From the backend, the admin user can create and manage suppliers, cars, locations, users and bookings.

When the admin user creates a new supplier, the supplier will receive an automatic email for creating his account to access the backend so he can manage his car fleet and bookings.

Below is the sign in page of the backend.

# Architecture

This section describes the software architecture of BookCars including the API, the frontend, the mobile app and the backend.

BookCars API is built with Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

BookCars backend and frontend are built with Node.js, React and MUI.

BookCars mobile app is built with React Native and Expo.

## API

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://bookcars.github.io/content/bookcars-architecture.drawio.png?raw=true" alt="" width="500" />
</p>

BookCars API exposes all BookCars functions needed for the backend, the frontend and the mobile app. The API follows the MVC design pattern. JWT is used for authentication. There are some functions that need authentication and others that does not need authentication.

* *./api/models/* folder contains MongoDB models.
* *./api/routes/* folder contains Express routes.
* *./api/controllers/* folder contains controllers.
* *./api/middlewares/* folder contains middlewares.
* *./api/server.js* is the main server where database connection is established and routes are loaded.
* *./api/app.js* is the main entry point of BookCars API.

## Frontend

The frontend is a web application built with Node.js, ReactJS and MUI. From the frontend the user can search for available cars depending on pickup and drop-off locations, dates and time booking. He can then select his booking options and finally checkout.

* *./frontend/assets/* folder contains CSS and images.
* *./frontend/components/* folder contains ReactJS pages.
* *./frontend/elements/* folder contains ReactJS components.
* *./frontend/services/* contains BookCars API client services.
* *./frontend/App.js* is the main ReactJS App that contains routes.
* *./frontend/index.js* is the main entry point of the frontend.

## Mobile App

BookCars provides a native mobile app for Android and iOS. The mobile app is built with React Native and Expo. Like for the frontend, the mobile app allows the user to search for available cars depending on pickup and drop-off locations, dates and time booking. He can then select his booking options and finally checkout.

The user receives push notifications when his bookings are updated. Push notifications are built with Node.js, Expo Server SDK and Firebase.

* *./mobile/assets/* folder contains images.
* *./mobile/screens/* folder contains main pages.
* *./mobile/elements/* folder contains React Native components.
* *./mobile/services/* contains BookCars API client services.
* *./mobile/App.js* is the main React Native App.
* *./mobile/index.js* is the main entry point of the mobile app.

## Backend

The backend is a web application built with Node.js, ReactJS and MUI. From the backend, the admin user can create and manage suppliers, cars, locations, users and bookings. When the admin user creates a new supplier, the supplier will receive an automatic email for creating his account to access the backend so he can manage his car fleet and bookings.

* *./backend/assets/* folder contains CSS and images.
* *./backend/components/* folder contains ReactJS pages.
* *./backend/elements/* folder contains ReactJS components.
* *./backend/services/* contains BookCars API client services.
